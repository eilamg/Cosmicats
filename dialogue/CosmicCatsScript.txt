Opening - After the power goes up.

Alfred: Woah...
Xena: Hmm?
Alfred: Look up!
Xena: Look up a- WOAH! When did all of that get up there?!
Alfred: It just appeared as soon as all the lights went off...
Xena: They're all... twinkly. Like... fish scales.
Alfred: Hey you're right... is that the ocean they always talk about?
Xena: Hmm... I'm not sure... I don't see any- oh! Right there!
Alfred: What? What's where?
Xena: It's a fish! Right there!
Alfred: Uh... I don't...
Xena: No, you're looking at it wrong! It's like this, see?
Alfred: Oh hey yeah! You're right!
Xena: Told ya.
Alfred: Are there any more up there?

Mermaid:

Alfred: Look, it's one of those... what do the humans call them... mermaids?
Xena: A what?
Alfred: You know, that thing where it's like half human, half fish.
Xena: ...so, a fish that walks around on-
Alfred: No! Wrong halves! See, it's like that!

Cat Fish:

Alfred: Hmm... something is missing...
Xena: How do you mean?
Alfred: Don't they seem lonely up there by themselves? Like they need a friend or maybe-
Xena: A CATFISH!
Alfred: ...is that even a thing?
Xena: Absolutely! See? Right there!
Alfred: Are you sure about that?
Xena: Of course they would have cat fish. Can you imagine if humans didn't have us?
Alfred: True, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves.

After Finishing Mermaid and Catfish:

Xena: Look, there's even more of them over there!
Alfred: Wow, it's like... an entire ocean kingdom in the sky!
Xena: Are they all fish though? Some of them look kinda... weird.

Milky Way:

Alfred: Look at that one! There's like... a zillion fish all swimming together.
Xena: Wow... how many is a zillion?
Alfred: Umm... a lot?

Octopus:

Xena: Look at that one, it's got like... eight tails!
Alfred: I... don't think those are tails.
Xena: Well, what else would they be?
Alfred: They're like... nooodly legs. With suction thingies on the bottom. And a head.
Xena: Pfft. And you think eight tails sounds rediculous.

Jellyfish:

Alfred: Hey, you know what that one looks like?
Xena: ...like that really ugly lamp your owner has? With all the shiny rocks hanging from it.
Alfred: What? No, it... well, kinda. But not that. 
Alfred: It looks like that gel blob stuff that humans make with those fruit chunks in it.
Xena: Oh yeah... what do you think it tastes like?
Alfred: Uh... fish?

Squid:

Xena: Oh, it's another one of those eight noodle head guys.
Alfred: Mmm... no, this one is different. See? It only has six of them.
Xena: Oh no! What happened to the other two?
Alfred: N-no... I mean... it's something different. Look, at the top of it's head. It has fins like a fish.
Xena: So... a six tailed noodle head fish?
Alfred: [sigh] Nevermind...

Shark:

Alfred: W-woah, that one looks... kind scary...
Xena: What, scared of the big bad fish?
Alfred: No way that's just a fish! Just look at how big they are! They'd probably eat you!
Xena: Not if I eat them first.

Ship:

Xena: Well now... what do we have here?
Alfred: A ship?
Xena: A /sunken/ ship. You know what that means.
Alfred: Uh...
Xena: That's right, treasure!
Alfred: Come again?
Xena: Sunken ships always have treasure in them! Like the ones you see in the fish tank... but this treasure must be MASSIVE!
Alfred: Well, doesn't look like they made it... I wonder...
Xena: Hmm?
Alfred: Maybe it was the mermaid's treasure and she and her trusty catfish companion were trying to get it back!
Xena: Oh yeah! That would make a lot of sense... but that's a lot of obsticales in their way.
Alfred: No kidding... and they're probably already so far from home... I mean, look at how BIG this ocean is!

[some kind of zooming out showing the sky on the whole if possible?]

Xena: Wow... there's so many of them... how do you think they'll even get home? 
Alfred: I mean... WHERE even is their home?
Xena: Well, once they get to the sunken ship, they'll probably have to swimp past th-

[power comes back on. The stars fade from visiblity. Back to city light]

Xena: What?! No fair! We were just getting started!
Alfred: Hmm... well, hey maybe next time it'll be a different story?
Xena: Huh... you think so?
Alfred: Well yeah, they just don't want everyone seeing them setting up for next time.
Xena: I guess so... well, should we meet here next time the lights go out?
Alfred: Absolutely! I wanna see what happens next too ya know.
